# The Complete Guide to Conjunctions

## 1. What are Conjunctions?
Conjunctions are the "glue" of the English language. They connect words, phrases, clauses, or sentences. Without them, our speech would be a series of short, choppy statements. They allow us to form complex ideas, show relationships between events, and create smooth transitions.

## 2. Types of Conjunctions
To master conjunctions, you must understand the three distinct categories:
1.  **Coordinating Conjunctions** (Connecting equals)
2.  **Subordinating Conjunctions** (Connecting unequal parts)
3.  **Correlative Conjunctions** (Pairs)

*(Note: We will also touch upon **Conjunctive Adverbs**, which often masquerade as conjunctions.)*

### 3. Coordinating Conjunctions (The "FANBOYS")
These connect elements of **equal grammatical rank**. They can join two nouns, two verbs, two phrases, or two independent clauses (complete sentences).

**Acronym:** **F**or, **A**nd, **N**or, **B**ut, **O**r, **Y**et, **S**o.

> **Punctuation Rule:** When joining two **independent clauses**, you must place a comma *before* the conjunction.
> * *Correct:* The grimace faded, **and** a smile took its place.
> * *Incorrect:* The grimace faded **and** a smile took its place.

### 4. Subordinating Conjunctions
These connect a **dependent (subordinate) clause** to an **independent clause**. They establish a relationship of time, reason, condition, or contrast.

> **Punctuation Rule:**
> 1. If the dependent clause comes **first**, use a comma. (*Because he was late**,** he ran.*)
> 2. If the dependent clause comes **second**, no comma is needed. (*He ran **because** he was late.*)

### 5. Correlative Conjunctions
These are "tag-team" conjunctions that always work in pairs.

### 6. The "Imposters": Conjunctive Adverbs
These are often confused with conjunctions, but they are technically adverbs used to transition between ideas. They are often stronger and more formal.

> **Punctuation Rule:** These cannot join two sentences with just a comma (that creates a "comma splice"). You must use a **semicolon** or a **period**.
> * *Formula:* Sentence A**;** transition word**,** Sentence B.
